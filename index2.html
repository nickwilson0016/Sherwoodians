                        WELCOME TO THE WOODY'S. THE FIRST ANNUAL SHERWOODIAN AWARDS
                        <br>
                        That's a wrap. It's over. Finished. Finito. As quick as it came (lol came) is as quick as it went. Things will never be the same after this season. Controversy, major trades, and Brendan’s first championship in the Belt era. Brendan may have re-written fantasy football in this league as we know it. He put his nuts on the table and told people Gator don’t play no shit. Gator never been about that, never never been about playing no shit. His nuts were out long enough that we all were like Jesus Christ dude enough of us have seen your dick before you can put it away. Danny put up a valiant effort. Aimed for the bushes. But in the end there was no awning in sight.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Other notable matchups this week included Nick vs. Mikey once again to see who would hold the number 1 overall pick in the 2026 draft. The draft once again runs through me.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        More importantly, the matchup we all care about. Arguably more than the championship. The Sacko. Colin vs. Brandon. Batman vs. Joker. Gilmore vs. Barker. Chocolate Bear vs. Vanilla Bear. Who sucks the least? In the end Colin decided to show up when it really mattered. I feel kind of bad for Brandon. He lives in the UK. He is forced to eat beans morning, noon, and night. And now he has to walk around knowing that he is a fucking Sacko. All those beans must have seeped into his fantasy team this year because his team laid a wet fart this year. The only thing left to wonder is what will his punishment be. More on that later in this note. But we must move on TO THE WOODY’S
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        
                        
                    </p>
                    <h4 class="text-xl font-bold mb-2 text-white text-center">Welcome one and all to the first annual Sherwoodian Awards</h4>
                    <p class="text-gray-300" mb-4>
                        The Woody’s if you will. Thank you to everyone who voted in this year's awards and congratulations to everyone who was nominated. The Woody’s is the second most prestigious award in the league behind the almighty Belt. This being the first annual awards there is only up from here. In future years we will have full presentations renting out American Legions. Catered food. Prestigious guests. Televised programming. Ad deals. The world is our oyster and if we can imagine it, we can make it happen… in our heads. Nevertheless, let's get to the awards!
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        The first award of the night is Fantasy Rookie of the Year. There were a lot of great options to choose from this season, but there were 4 that really stuck out. The nominees are:
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <b>Jaxon Dart - New York Giants QB</b>
                        <br>
                        Dart came on to the scene fast this season. He finished as QB16 on the year and led all rookies in concussions sustained throughout the year.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <b>Ashton Jeanty - Las Vegas Raiders RB</b>
                        <br>
                        Jeanty started the season off slow and played for the dogshit Raiders. However, that couldn’t stop Jeanty from leading all rookies in fantasy points this year.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <b>Emeka Egbuka - Tampa Bay Bucs WR</b>
                        <br>
                        Egbuka had the biggest burst on to the scene with his week 5 breakout. However, the end of the season was mediocre at best.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <b>TreVeyon Henderson - New England Patriots RB</b>
                        <br>
                        Oh baby, did things start slow for Henderson. Barley played in games to start the season. But then holy shit. He's the fastest kid alive. Leading all rookies in 50+ yard rushes and 50+ yard touchdown runs.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <em>The winner of the 2025Woody for Rookie of the Year goes to:</em>
                        <br>
                        <em><b>TreVeyon Henderson - </b>This is TreVeyon's first nomination for Rookie of the Year and first win. TreVeyon was unanimously voted to win Rookie of the Year.</em>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        The second Woody of the night is the Most Valuable Player award. There were many great contestants but only one stuck out. The nominees:
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <b>Drake "The Schedule" Maye - New England Patriots QB</b>
                        <br>
                        Many have argued that the Patriots had the easiest schedule in the NFL since 1995. As such Drake Maye should have performed as well as he did. But he didn’t make the schedule. You play the opponent in front of you.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <b>DM10 - New England Patriots QB</b>
                        <br>
                        How blessed have we been to have witnessed TB12 to start this dynasty and now we are blessed with DM10 to continue it.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <b>Drake "Drake Maye" Maye - New England Patriots QB</b>
                        <br>
                        This doesn't really require an explanation.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <em>The winner of the 2025 Woody for Most Valuable Player is:</em>
                        <br>
                        <em><b>Drake "Drake Maye" Maye - </b>This is Drake "Drake Maye" Maye's first nomination and first MVP. Maye received 75% of the first place votes</em>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Next up, we have the Woody for Biggest Bust. From horrible fantasy performances to all time splooges. The nominees for Biggest Bust are:
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <b>Justin Jefferson - Minnesota Vikings WR</b>
                        <br>
                        Jefferson was the first overall pick in the 2025 draft and holy shit was he horrible. Well really 9 was horrible. JJ McCarthy was decent but 9… 9 was not letting the Justin Jefferson peacock fly.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <b>Brian Thomas - Jacksonville Jaguars WR</b>
                        <br>
                        Oh man 2024 Brian Thomas was awesome wasn’t he? A breakout rookie that was poised to have a great sophomore season. Draft 7th overall in the 2025 draft he finished as WR44 on the season and just so happened to be on the Sacko’s team.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <b>Brendan Cary - Lowell Mass Father of Two</b>
                        <br>
                        Brendan is the only one of us with children (that we know of). You don’t have 2 kids without being a big bust guy, not in this economy.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        And the winner of the 2025 Woody for Biggest Bust..... Will be announced after this word from our sponsor.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        This year's sponsor for the 2025 Woody's is Jimmies

                        Whether it's chocolate sprinkles or condoms, Gator’s bitches better be using them - because nothing ruins a fantasy season quite like responsibilities.

                        Now back to the Woody's
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <em>The winner of the 2025 Woody for Biggest Bust is:</em>
                        <br>
                        <em><b>Brendan Cary - </b>This is Brendan’s first nomination and first win for Biggest Bust. Some would say his children are the only award he needs but that was before he won this Woody. Brendan received 62.5% of the vote with Jefferson receiving 25% and Thomas receiving 12.5%.</em>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Now we are getting into the good stuff. The league specific awards. Where all of us are nominated for multiple awards.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        The first league specific Woody is Gate of the Year. The nominees for Gate of the Year are:
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <b>Mikey and Brendan - Veto-Gate</b>
                        <br>
                        This is a gate that has been brewing for a few years. Arguments over what the veto represents to what a fair trade really is. It finally came to a boiling point this year when a trade between Mikey and Brendan was vetoed.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <b>Collusion-Gate</b>
                        <br>
                        This is still an ongoing investigation and thus I cannot comment on the parties involved or the findings of the investigation. What I can say is that a Review Board 2.0 has been created and all the necessary parties have been contacted. Once the investigation is complete more information will be revealed.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <b>Danny-Mastered-The-Dark-Arts-Gate</b>
                        <br>
                        Who hasn’t been a victim of Danny intentionally (allegedly) congratulating you on a win only to have the matchup flipped and end up in a hardy loss.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <em>The winner of the Gate of the Year Woody goes to:
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Wait what's that?
                        <br>
                        Is that possible?
                        <br>
                        Well what do we do now?
                        <br>
                        Okay, I'll tell them
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Ladies and Gentlemen for the first time in Woody’s history we have a tie. As a result the winner for Gate of the Year goes to:</em>
                        <br>
                        <em><b>Mikey and Brendan for Veto-Gate AND Danny for Danny-Mastered-The-Dark-Arts-Gate - </b>This is Mikey, Brendan, and Danny's first nomination for Gate of the Year and Mikey and Danny's first ever Woody win. This is Brendan's second Woody award. Both Gate's received 37.5% of the vote.</em>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Next we have GM of the Year. Let me tell you something. This was very funny because to maintain integrity in the voting system the survey to vote on these awards was kept anonymous…. That of course being until we got to this award because we all voted for ourselves. Except for 2 people. Does one of these people have the most integrity of all of us? (famously no as I have noted this person has no honor and no integrity). Was this just a big brain move by both of them? (Maybe) Was one of them in the Sacko? (Possibly) Was this Colin and Phil? (Absolutely)
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <em>But how do you know it was Colin and Phil? It could be anyone. You said it yourself, the voting was anonymous.</em>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Great question voice of public opinion. If I’m wrong boy is that egg on my face but I’m going to go out on a limb and say that the only 2 who didn’t receive a single vote are the ones who didn’t vote for themselves.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        That said...
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <em>The winner of GM of the Year goes to:</em>

                        <em><b>Danny - </b>This is Danny's second ever Woody award and hopefully is a small consoloation prize for losing the championship. Danny received 37.5% of the vote while there was a 5 way tie for second place between Brendan, Brandon, Nick, Sam, and Mikey.</em>

                        Now we get to another goody. The Worst GM of the Year. A chance for us to shit on some of our closest friends and fiercest competitors. Yet again we are stuck in a tricky situation. Because we have another tie!

                        Lastly, everyone was asked to give a Sacko Punishment idea and I must say, the ideas were all creative, responsible, and not at all a financial burden. That said, I think it is only fair that we put all 7 (because we had a duplicate) possible punishments into a wheel and spin it to see what the punishment is for this year's Sacko (aka Brandon). A 14.2% chance at:

                        Everyone in the league must send $50 to the Sacko (Now again I’d like to once again emphasize that the voting was anonymous for this. However, this submission also included 2 sets of black prayer hand emojis. So unless Mikey is using black hand emojis (which is extremely progressive and wouldn’t at all be problematic) I think we can assume this one is probably Brandon)

                        All of this said, we will probably have to put this up to a vote at next year's pre-draft meeting. We’ll probably vote on it, argue about it, threaten lawsuits, and then do none of it — just like every other important league decision.

                        Lastly, now that the season is officially over. We know exactly what next years draft order is going to be. And since we are always asking what it is going to be I figured where is a better place to put the 2026 Draft Order than right here on our league history site.

                        Shoutout Brendan for inspiring this section. He is the only one to change his team name this season. We need a refresh and I'm dropping the gauntlet. By this time next week everyone needs to have an updated team name. If you can figure it out, also upload a new photo for your team logo. Get creative. Come up with something new. Use AI to create a logo of Malik Nabers in a StateFarm polo, CeeDee's head on a lamb, Bill Croskey-Merritt dressed as Bill Nye (BILL BILL BILL BILL BILL - BILL NYE THE SCIENCE GUY). I will have a new name and logo before Thursday's game kicks off and all of you better too.
